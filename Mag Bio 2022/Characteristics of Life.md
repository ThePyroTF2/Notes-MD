## Notes
### Characteristics of Life
- Organization
    - All life is made of cells
- Homeostasis
    - Certain things need to be kept in balance (temp, PH)
    - A living thing must be able to maintain this balance
- Reproduction
    - Cell regeneration and growth fulfills this category
- Growth and development
- Response to stimuli
- Evolution

### Obtaining and Using Energy
Glucose is a form of chemical energy. Breaking the chemical bonds releases energy that can be used to move other molecueles (motion) or store din other bonds (chemical).

Glucose: $H_6C_{12}O_6$

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is also chemical energy. It is more efficient than any other molecule at providing usable energy or cells. All known living things use ATP to power their cells. Breaks apart into phosphate and ADP. ADP gets refilled for reuse. 

ATP: $C_{10}H_{16}N_5O_{13}P_3$  
ADP: $C_{10}H_{15}N_5O_{10}P_2$  
Phosphate: ${PO_4}^{3+}$

### Elements of Life
While the periodic table shows over 100 elements, only a handful of these are critically important in living organisms, and most are only ever seen in artificial conditions.

Big ones:
- Hydrogen, $H$
- Carbon, $C$
- Nitrogen, $N$
- Oxygen, $O$
- Phosphorus, $P$
- Sulfur, $S$

These elements are critical for building the molecules that ake up the structure of living bodies.

Important elements as ions:
- Sodium, $Na$
- Magnesium, $Mg$
- Chlorine, $Cl$
- Potassium, $K$
- Calcium, $Ca$
- Iron, $Fe$

These elements are critical for many of the processes that occur in an organism's body

### Organic and Inorganic Molecules
Organic molecules **must** have carbon. They generally have carbon-hydrogen or carbon-carbon bonds. Chemically, "organic" has nothing to do with "healthy" or "good for you".

### Building Upwards
***Monomers*** (one unit) are molecules that can be linked together to form larger ***polymers*** (many units)

### Boilogically important polymers
There are four categores of biologically important polymers:
- Carbohydrates
- Lipids
- Proteins
- Nucleic Acids
Each has unique monomers and specific characteristics

### Biologically Important Monomers
- Glycerol + fatty acids OR cholesterol backbone; Lipids
- Amino acid; Protein
- Nucleotide; Nucleic acid
- Monosacharide; Carbohydrate
