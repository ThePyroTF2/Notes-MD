# Trophic levels - November 3, 2022
## Key terms
- Niche
    - Unique key role that a species plays in an ecosystem. No two species occupy the same niche
- Autotroph
    - Makes its own food (I.E. photosynthesis)
- Heterotroph
    - Eats other organisms
- Omnivore
    - Eats all kinds of organisms
- Carnivore
    - Eats animals
- Herbivore
    - Eats plants
- Detritavore
    - Eats dead biomass - think mushrooms and decomposition
## Notes 
- Troph - refers to feeding or energy
- Levels
    1. Primary heterotrophs
    2. Secondary heterotrophs
    3. Tertiary heterotrophs
- This continues...
- Bottom - autotrophs
### Transcendentalist walk
- The only animals I saw were small bugs. There were only these little white dudes hovering around and I couldn't identify what kind of bug they were. There was also a single little crawly bug that was able to walk on the water in the stream.
- There were a **lot** of trees. One thing that was interesting to observe was the individual leaves falling.
- There was a noticeable gradient in leaf color from green to yellow to orange from the floor to the top of the trees.
- I saw no real examples of competition or interaction between organisms.
- There was a thin film on the surface of the still water. At first I thought it was a lighting effect, but after someone near me began stirring the water around a bit (I was going to focus on the ripples), I noticed the film dissipate.
# Keystone Species and Trophic Cascades - November 4, 2022
## Notes
- Keystone species, as the name suggests, are species that are depended upon by a large number of other species.
- Keystone species can be on any trophic level.
- When keystone species of an ecosystem are diminished or removed, the effect is a [_trophic cascade_](#trophic-cascades)

# Predators and prey - November 9, 2022
## Notes
### The green world Hypothesis
- Predators are needed to keep herbivore numbers at or below carrying capacity
- This is different than "bottom-up" ideas, which say the number of herbivores is determined by the amount of plant biomass
- **Both Green World and Bottom-Up hypotheses are overly simplistic views of ecosystems**
### <a name="Trophic-Cascades"/> Trophic Cascades
- A chain of relationships betwen species
- Example
    - Grass produces energy for ecosystem
    - Snails eat grass; Too many snails = very little grass
    - Crabs eat snails, keeping everything in check
